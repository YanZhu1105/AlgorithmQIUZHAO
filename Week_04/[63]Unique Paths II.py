# A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in t
# he diagram below). 
# 
#  The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot 
# is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the d
# iagram below). 
# 
#  Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths 
# would there be? 
# 
#  
# 
#  An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid. 
# 
#  Note: m and n will be at most 100. 
# 
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input:
# [
# ¬† [0,0,0],
# ¬† [0,1,0],
# ¬† [0,0,0]
# ]
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
# There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
# 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
# 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
