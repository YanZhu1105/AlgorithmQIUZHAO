# Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock 
# on day i. 
# 
#  Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many tran
# sactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times
# ) with the following restrictions: 
# 
#  
#  You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must se
# ll the stock before you buy again). 
#  After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 
# day) 
#  
# 
#  Example: 
# 
#  
# Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
# Output: 3 
# Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
